# Housing-Price-Prediction--Regression

# Housing Price Prediction

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for housing prices based on various features such as location, number of rooms, and other property characteristics. By accurately predicting house prices, the model provides insights into market trends and supports informed decision-making for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

## Methodology

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- **Data Overview**: The dataset consists of features like property size, location, number of bedrooms, and historical sales prices.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, removed outliers, and standardized numerical features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created additional features based on domain knowledge to improve model performance.

### Model Development
- **Baseline Model**: Started with simple linear regression to establish a baseline.
- **Advanced Models**: Explored machine learning techniques including:
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
  - Neural Networks for non-linear feature interactions

### Evaluation Metrics
- The models were evaluated using:
  - **R-Square**: To measure the proportion of variance explained by the model.
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: To quantify prediction errors.
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: For penalizing larger errors.

## Results
- The final model demonstrated a significant improvement in prediction accuracy over the baseline.
- Key insights:
  - Location and property size were the most influential factors in determining price.
  - Feature importance analysis revealed hidden trends in the housing market.

## Conclusion
The project successfully built a reliable housing price prediction model. It highlights the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning in achieving optimal performance. Future work could involve:
- Expanding the dataset to include additional features such as economic indicators.
- Exploring time-series models for dynamic price trends.
- Deploying the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
